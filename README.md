Tray indicator for Corsair HS80 Headset

![Tray indicator](tray.png)

## Features

- Battery level
- Charging state

#### WIP
Only gets the messages the headset reports back, so it takes a while to display for the first time.

Still trying to decode captured data between iCUE and the Wireless Receiver, in order to request status report directly instead of waiting for the headset to report a change of state.
